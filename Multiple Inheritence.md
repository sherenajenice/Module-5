# Arithmetic Operations Using Multiple Inheritance in Python

This Python program demonstrates **multiple inheritance** by performing basic arithmetic operations â€” Addition, Subtraction, and Division â€” using three classes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance**.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Define `Calculation1` class**
   - Contains `Summation(a, b)` method to return the sum of two numbers.
2. **Define `Calculation2` class**
   - Contains `Subtraction(a, b)` method to return the difference of two numbers.
3. **Define `Derived` class**
   - Inherits from both `Calculation1` and `Calculation2`.
   - Contains `Division(a, b)` method to return the division result.
4. **Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
5. **Process**
   - Create an object of the `Derived` class.
   - Call `Summation`, `Subtraction`, and `Division` methods.
6. **Output**
   - Display the results of the three operations.

## ðŸ’» Program 
class Calculation1:

def div(self,a,b):  
   
   return a/b;  

class Calculation2:

def sub(self,a,b):  
    
    return a-b;  

class Derived(Calculation1,Calculation2):

def Mul(self,a,b):  
    
    return a*b;  

a=int(input()) 

b=int(input())

d = Derived()

print(d.div(a,b))

print(d.sub(a,b))

print(d.Mul(a,b))

## Result
Thus, To write a Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance** is verified.
